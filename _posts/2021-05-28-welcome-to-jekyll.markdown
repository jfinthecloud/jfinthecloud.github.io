Finished setting up my blog. 

I used Jekyll to build the static webiste and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Plans for future posts:
I need to refresh my data analysis and visualization skills. I will publish posts as I go through the homework and projects from Washington University Data Analytics Boot Camp.

I have also subscribed to Daily Coding Program for over 2 years. I will attempt to work on these.
